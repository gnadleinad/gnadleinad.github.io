# French Flashcard Maker

This was my first web development project that I finished in July 2020, in the middle of my genetic algorithm internship at University of Wisconsin. This is a flashcard maker for myself and a few friends that are in French class together. It's supposed to turn words that I've looked up in the dictionary into flashcards that we can review. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I recieved help with API requests as well as AWS from a friend.

In this project, I learned:

- Bootstrap
- Basic CSS
- Fetching
- Dealing with JSON

Here is a screenshot!
